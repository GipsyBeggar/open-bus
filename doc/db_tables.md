## SIRI tables

Tables of data extracted from the SIRI service using [fetch_and_store_arrivals](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/doc/fetch_and_store_arrivals.md). 

- `responses` - raw responses 
- `arrivals` - parsed response

## GTFS Tables

Tables loaded from the GTFS file. 
  * [More information about GTFS](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/doc/working_with_GTFS.md) including an [Entity Relation Diagram](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/doc/gtfs_src_entity_diagram.png). 
  * Examples of [GTFS-related SQL queries](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/doc/useful_GTFS_queries.md)
  * Information about [inserting the GTFS to the DB](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/doc/Inserting_GTFS_to_PostGRES.md).

- `agency`
- `routes`
- `stops`
- `trips`
- `calendar`
- `stop_times`
- `shape`

## Route Stories

Route stories are a compressed version of stop_times. See the [docstring of the module that generates them](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/blob/master/gtfs/parser/route_stories.py) for more info.

* `route_story_stops`
* `trip_route_stories` 

## Bus stops near train stations

Data generated for the bus2train task.  See [issue #7](https://github.com/hasadna/open-bus/issues/7) for more information on how and why they were created. 

- `train_station_exits` has coordinates of the entrances and exits to train stations (the GTFS stops table only have an approximate coordinate in the middle of each station). 

- `station_walking_distance` has bus stops that are near train stations. It includes the straight line distance, and the length of the walking route using two route services: Google Maps and [Graphopper](https://graphhopper.com/). 

## Train passengers counts

  `train_passenger_counts`
  
The number of passengers traveling beween each pair of train stations, per month.

We currenly have data for January - April 2016. This data was originally published in Tapuz's Public Transport forum. It seems that it arrives from Israel Railway spokesperson's office, but it's not clear how it was calculated by Isral Railway. The originl file from the forum is [here](https://github.com/daphshez/openbus_data/blob/master/train_station_passengers/passenger%20by%20line%202016-01-04.xlsx). 

Open train project have [an archive of older data published in the same forum](http://otrain.org/files/count/). There are per-station statistics rather than per station pair.
